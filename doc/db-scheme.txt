We should probably do some diagram in pdf with the scheme;

I looked for some solutions:
- vectr.com online tool
- draw.io
- https://www.lucidchart.com
- https://github.com/sualeh/SchemaCrawler
	- thats really interesting solution ->
		generates diagram from our database
		so here from our sqlite sql creation script;
		Thats sound like really good tool
		to keep documentation up do date;
		is not to plan design;
What are my requirements:
- possibility to export to PDF or SVG format to inline here;
