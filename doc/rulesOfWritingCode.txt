1. Commenting code.
	Comment that code which is not obvious;
	if you dont have enough time or would it be
	too laborious comment just how to use it:
		@Usage
		e.g. draw("sciana", ["zolty", "zielony"])
		e.g. my_git_diff HEAD
2. Write good commit message for commits which do a lot.
	First line should contain short description.
	In next lines you can put more.
	You dont need to tell which files you modified ->
		that can be simply checked by git commands,
	tell what you did.
